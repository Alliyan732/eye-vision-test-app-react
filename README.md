# Eye Vision Assessments App

## Overview

The Vision Assessment App is a web application developed in React Native that aims to assess various aspects of vision, including colorblindness, contrast sensitivity, astigmatism, and vision acuity. This app provides a user-friendly interface for individuals to self-administer these tests and receive feedback on their vision health.

## Features

- **Colorblind Test:** Assess color vision deficiencies through a series of carefully designed color perception challenges.

- **Contrast Sensitivity Test:** Evaluate the ability to distinguish subtle differences in shades and contrasts.

- **Astigmatism Test:** Identify issues related to astigmatism through targeted visual assessments.

- **Vision Acuity Test:** Measure the clarity of vision by testing the ability to recognize and discern letters or symbols.
